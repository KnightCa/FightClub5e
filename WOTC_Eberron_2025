    <autolevel level="1"><feature><name>Level 1: Spellcasting (Cantrips 2, Prepared 2)</name>
        <text>You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects.

Tools Required:
• You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves' Tools, Tinker's Tools, or another kind of Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an "M" component when you cast it).

Cantrips:
• You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Shocking Grasp are recommended.
• Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.
• When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.

Spell Slots:
• The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+:
• You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.
• The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column below. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.
• If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells:
• Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability:
• Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

Plans Known:
• When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table. Alchemy Jug, Cap of Water Breathing, Rope of Climbing, and Sending Stones are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.
• You learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels (6th, 10th, 14th, 18th). When you choose a plan to learn, you
choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.

	• Varies | Common magic item that isn't a Potion, a Scroll, or cursed (you can learn this option multiple times and must select a different item each time; each item selected counts as a different plan)

Creating an Item:
• When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items (from the plans you know) if you have Tinker’s Tools in hand.
• At any given time, the maximum number of magic items from this feature is two. Your maximum increases by one when you reach certain Artificer levels (6th, 10th, 14th, 18th).
• If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.
• Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.
• If a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.

Level 	| Magic Items Created (Maximum)
2-5 	| 2
6-9 	| 3
10-13 	| 4
14-17 	| 5
18-20 	| 6

Duration:
• A magic item created by this feature functions exactly like the normal magic item, except its magic isn't permanent. When you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days.
• If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.
• If an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

Spellcasting Focus:
You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan’s Tools.

            <text>Using Woodcarver's Tools or Smith's Tools, you can take a Magic action to create a Small or Tiny Eldritch Cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of yourself. You determine its appearance, including whether you carry it or not (and your choice of legs or wheels, for the latter). It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as a Magic action.

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while you already have one.

Eldritch Cannon:
	• Small or Tiny Object
	• Armor Class: 18
	• Hit Points: 5 × your Artificer level (casting Mending on the cannon restores 2d6 Hit Points to it)
	• Immunities: Poison, Psychic
	• Activate Cannon (Bonus, Requires You to be within 60 Feet of the Cannon). As a Bonus Action, you order the cannon to use the Flamethrower, Force Ballista, or Protector option below; you can direct the cannon to move up to 15 feet before or after that option.
		• Flamethrower. The cannon exhales fire in a 15-foot Cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the Cone that aren’t being worn or carried start burning.
		• Force Ballista. Make a ranged spell attack originating from the cannon at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 Force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.
		• Protector. The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

You can use your Arcane Firearm as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells. When you cast an Artificer spell through the firearm, roll 1d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

Detonate (Reaction):
When your cannon takes damage, you can take a Reaction to command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Firepower:
The cannon's damage rolls and the number of Temporary Hit Points granted by Protector increase by 1d8.

You can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action, ordering them to use the same activation option or different ones. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.

The Defender in Combat (Bonus):
In combat, the defender acts during your turn. It can move and take its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the defender acts on its own and isn't limited to the Dodge action.

Restoring or Replacing the Defender:
If the defender has died within the last hour, you can take a Magic action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can create a new Steel Defender if you have Smith's Tools in hand. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one vanishes.

Steel Defender:

When casting a spell or creating another effect that requires being able to see the effect’s target, a map holder can target another map holder regardless of sight or cover, so long as the other map holder is still within the effect’s range.

      <text>With ever-changing appearances, changelings reside in many societies undetected. Each changeling can supernaturally adopt any face they like. For some changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.

The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today — even in those who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.

In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see one in that form, for a typical changeling alters their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape — one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history — is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities with more depth, crafting a persona complete with history and beliefs to go with each shape. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.

Multiple changelings can share a persona; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even pass down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona’s previous users.

      <text>Kalashtar (pronounced kal-ASH-tar) are created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits called quori from the plane of dreams. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. They have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are concentrating or expressing strong emotions.

Source:	Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</text>
    </trait>
    <trait><name>Bound to Spirits</name>
      <text>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar can’t communicate directly with their quori spirits. Rather, kalashtar might experience them as a source of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the spirits’ memories when the kalashtar sleep. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psionic attacks.

All of these dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of the linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but for some (for instance, an orphan kalashtar raised among outsiders) may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts.

The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks of behavior. Select a trait from the following table.

Kalashtar Quirks:
d10 | Quirk
1 | You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies.
2 | You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud.
3 | You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent.
4 | You apply dream logic to mundane situations.
5 | You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit.
6 | You suppress your emotions and rely on logic.

    <trait><name>Mind Link (10 feet)</name>
      <text>You have telepathy with a range in feet equal to 10 times your level. When you’re using this trait to speak telepathically to a creature, you can take a Magic action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until you take another Magic action to end this effect.
	  
Telepathy: The contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language to understand this communication, but the contacted creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself to understand.

A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted creature, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken if either the telepath or the other creature has the Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also broken if the contacted creature is no longer within the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a different creature within range.

Once a telepathic conversation starts, the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the telepath until the telepathic connection ends.</text>

      <text>Over the course of centuries, those descended from both humans and elves have developed their own communities and traditions in Khorvaire. The rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani has strengthened this identity. Members of these communities call themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning “children of Khorvaire,” as they dislike the term “half-elf.”

Many Khoravar espouse the idea of being “the bridge between,” believing they are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others, fascinated by their distant connection to the Fey, seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become druids or warlocks with archfey patrons.

    <speed>30</speed>
    <trait><name>Description</name>
      <text>Shifters — sometimes called “weretouched” — descend from people who contracted full or partial lycanthropy. Humanoids with a bestial aspect, shifters can’t change shape fully, but they can enhance their animalistic features temporarily in a process they call “shifting.”
	  
Shifters resemble humans in height and build but are typically more lithe and flexible. Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also possess prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, the shifter remains clearly identifiable as a Humanoid even when at their most feral.

Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. You can choose the kind of lycanthrope in your past, or you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Lycanthrope Ancestor table. The table also provides a suggestion for the Shifting option you might have as a result of your ancestry.

d6 | Ancestor | Suggested Shifting Option
1 | Werebear | Beasthide
2 | Wereboar | Beasthide
3 | Wererat | Swiftstride
4 | Weretiger | Swiftstride
5 | Werewolf (wolflike) | Longtooth
6 | Werewolf (doglike) | Wildhunt

Subraces:
	• Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within. Beasthide shifters are typically tied to the bear or the boar, but any creature known for its toughness could apply.
	• Longtooth shifters are fierce and aggressive, but they form deep bonds with their friends. Many longtooth shifters have canine traits that become more pronounced as they shift, but they might instead draw on tigers, hyenas, or other predators.
	• Swiftstride shifters are graceful and quick. Typically feline in nature, swiftstride shifters are often aloof and difficult to pin down physically or socially.
	• Wildhunt shifters are sharp and insightful. Some are constantly alert, ever wary for possible threats. Others focus on their intuition, searching within. Wildhunt shifters are excellent hunters, and they also tend to become the spiritual leaders of shifter communities.

    <trait><name>Description</name>
      <text>Warforged are mechanical beings built as weapons to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sentient beings made from wood and metal that nevertheless can feel pain and emotion.

Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

Warforged comprise a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Rootlike cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. The more a warforged cultivates their individuality, the more likely they are to modify their body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of their face, limbs, and plating.

Quirks: Warforged often display an odd personality trait or two, given how new they are to the world. The Warforged Quirks table contains example quirks.

d8 | Quirk
1 | You analyze—out loud—the potential threat posed by every creature you meet.
2 | You often misread emotional cues.
3 | You are fiercely protective of your friends.
4 | You try to apply wartime discipline to every situation.
5 | You don't know how to filter your feelings and are prone to dramatic emotional outbursts.
6 | You don't understand clothing beyond its utility and assume it denotes a person's function.
7 | You are obsessed with your appearance and constantly polish and buff yourself.

      <text>Dragonmarks are mysterious and magical symbols that appear on the skin of some people across Khorvaire. You bear an aberrant dragonmark. These rare marks appear on members of all species. Aberrant dragonmarks disturb the houses — you would be wise to avoid their attention.

You gain the following benefits.

Aberrant Fortitude (Reaction): When you fail a Constitution saving throw, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success. Once you’ve used this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

Aberrant Magic: You know one cantrip of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list. Also, choose a level 1 spell from that spell list. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have.
	• Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Aberrant Surge: When you cast the level 1 spell from this feat, you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice and roll it. If you roll an even number, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled. If you roll an odd number, one creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes Force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.

You also develop a random flaw from the table below.

d8 | Flaw
1 | Your mark is a source of constant physical pain.
2 | Your mark whispers to you. Its meaning can be unclear.
3 | When you're stressed, the mark hisses audibly.
4 | The skin around the mark is burned, scaly, or withered.
5 | Animals are uneasy around you.
6 | You have a mood swing any time you use your mark.
7 | Your looks change slightly whenever you use the mark.
8 | You have horrific nightmares after you use your mark.

    <trait><name>Origin Feat: Mark of Making</name>
      <text>Dragonmarks are mysterious and magical symbols that appear on the skin of some people across Khorvaire. The twelve established dragonmarks are tied to specific family lines, and the scions of those families work hard at consolidating the power of the marks in order to maximize the profit and influence they gain from them. The Mark of Healing, for example, has given the halflings of House Jorasco an edge in providing medical care; the house has exploited that edge to the point where it remains virtually the only provider of healing services.
	  
Dragonmarks typically appear for the first time in situations of stress or peril where the power of the mark could prove useful, heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite of passage called the Test of Siberys in adolescence. Each house’s test is different, but they all involve some danger designed to evoke the power of the house’s mark.

      <text>Dragonmarks are mysterious and magical symbols that appear on the skin of some people across Khorvaire. The twelve established dragonmarks are tied to specific family lines, and the scions of those families work hard at consolidating the power of the marks in order to maximize the profit and influence they gain from them. The Mark of Healing, for example, has given the halflings of House Jorasco an edge in providing medical care; the house has exploited that edge to the point where it remains virtually the only provider of healing services.
	  
Dragonmarks typically appear for the first time in situations of stress or peril where the power of the mark could prove useful, heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite of passage called the Test of Siberys in adolescence. Each house’s test is different, but they all involve some danger designed to evoke the power of the house’s mark.

    <trait><name>Origin Feat: Mark of Scribing</name>
      <text>Dragonmarks are mysterious and magical symbols that appear on the skin of some people across Khorvaire. The twelve established dragonmarks are tied to specific family lines, and the scions of those families work hard at consolidating the power of the marks in order to maximize the profit and influence they gain from them. The Mark of Healing, for example, has given the halflings of House Jorasco an edge in providing medical care; the house has exploited that edge to the point where it remains virtually the only provider of healing services.
	  
Dragonmarks typically appear for the first time in situations of stress or peril where the power of the mark could prove useful, heirs of the dragonmarked houses undergo a rite of passage called the Test of Siberys in adolescence. Each house’s test is different, but they all involve some danger designed to evoke the power of the house’s mark. Usually, a dragonmark appears during the test, if it ever manifests at all, but heirs sometimes manifest their marks years after failing the Test of Siberys.
	  
You gain the following benefits.

Gifted Scribe: When you make an Intelligence (History) check or an ability check using Calligrapher’s Supplies, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

	• When you reach character level 3, you also always have the Magic Mouth spell prepared and can cast it the same way.

  <feat><name>[Eberron] Origin: Dragonmark, Aberrant (Reaction)</name>
    <prerequisite>Aberrant Heir background or Level 4+, Can't Have Another Dragonmark Origin Feat, Eberron Campaign</prerequisite>
    <text>Dragonmarks are mysterious and magical symbols that appear on the skin of some people across Khorvaire. You bear an aberrant dragonmark. These rare marks appear on members of all species. Aberrant dragonmarks disturb the houses — you would be wise to avoid their attention.
	
Marks of Mystery: Centuries of manipulation and consolidation have caused the established dragonmarks to manifest primarily in members of certain family lines. However, exceptions have always existed, and they’ve grown increasingly common in recent years.
	  
Distant Offshoot:
You are a distant offshoot of a dragonmarked family line, sharing the species that most commonly manifests the mark but unencumbered by ties to its house. For example, you could be a Halfling with the Mark of Healing but with no ties to House Jorasco. You’re an anomaly; if House Jorasco became aware of you, it would try to bring you and your family line into the house. To build this kind of character, choose a Dragonmark feat at level 4 or later.

Mark of Prophecy:
You might bear a mark unrelated to your species. For example, you can choose to bear the Mark of Healing even if you’re not a Halfling. Your dragonmark has nothing to do with the house’s family line. It might be a direct mark of the Draconic Prophecy, or it could be an Aberrant Mark that happens to duplicate an established one. You’ll probably never meet an NPC in the world like you, and a House might not claim you.

You gain the following benefits.

Aberrant Fortitude (Reaction): When you fail a Constitution saving throw, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the save, potentially turning the failure into a success. Once you’ve used this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

Aberrant Magic: You know one cantrip of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list. Also, choose a level 1 spell from that spell list. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have.
	• Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

Aberrant Surge: When you cast the level 1 spell from this feat, you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice and roll it. If you roll an even number, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled. If you roll an odd number, one creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes Force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.

You also develop a random flaw from the table below.

d8 | Flaw
1 | Your mark is a source of constant physical pain.
2 | Your mark whispers to you. Its meaning can be unclear.
3 | When you're stressed, the mark hisses audibly.
4 | The skin around the mark is burned, scaly, or withered.
5 | Animals are uneasy around you.
6 | You have a mood swing any time you use your mark.
7 | Your looks change slightly whenever you use the mark.
8 | You have horrific nightmares after you use your mark.

The twelve established dragonmarks are tied to specific family lines, and the scions of those families work hard at consolidating the power of the marks in order to maximize the profit and influence they gain from them. The Mark of Healing, for example, has given the halflings of House Jorasco an edge in providing medical care; the house has exploited that edge to the point where it remains virtually the only provider of healing services. 
	
Marks of Mystery: Centuries of manipulation and consolidation have caused the established dragonmarks to manifest primarily in members of certain races and family lines. However, exceptions have always existed, and they’ve grown increasingly common in recent years.
	• Distant Offshoot (Human, not related to House Cannith): You are a distant offshoot of a dragonmarked family line, sharing the species that most commonly manifests the mark but unencumbered by ties to its house. You’re an anomaly; if House Cannith became aware of you, it would try to bring you and your family line into the house.
	• Mark of Prophecy (Not Human): You might bear a Mark unrelated to the Race normally associated with the Mark. Your dragonmark has nothing to do with the house’s family line. It might be a direct mark of the Draconic Prophecy, or it could be an Aberrant Mark that happens to duplicate an established one. You’ll probably never meet an NPC in the world like you, and House Cannith might not claim you.

You gain the following benefits.

Artisan’s Intuition: When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check or an ability check using Artisan’s Tools, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check.

Spellsmith: You know the Mending cantrip. You also always have the Magic Weapon spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have.

When a greater dragonmark manifests, it grows from an ordinary mark and expands outward to two or three times the original mark’s size.
	
The dragonmarked houses view greater marks as more significant than ordinary marks in every way — more important to the livelihood of the house, more essential to keep under the house’s control, and potentially more significant in terms of fulfilling the Draconic Prophecy that some believe is written in the marks.

You gain the following benefits.

Ability Score Increase: Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Improved Intuition: When you use the Gifted Scribe benefit of your Mark of Scribing feat, you can roll 1d6 instead of 1d4.

Inspired Scribing: When you cast Comprehend Languages, you can modify the spell to encompass up to three willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Each chosen creature also gains the benefits of the spell for the duration. In addition, for the duration of the spell, you and the chosen creatures can communicate telepathically with each other while within 1 mile of each other. Once you modify the spell with this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

    <text>The Boon of Siberys can reflect either a Siberys mark or a powerful Aberrant Mark.
	
While the people of Khorvaire have a limited understanding of dragonmarks, Siberys dragonmarks remain a complete mystery to them. The magic of these powerful marks clearly relates—visually and thematically — to the other marks in one’s house. But a dragonmarked heir may spend years perfecting and mastering the powers of a mark without ever manifesting a Siberys mark. Meanwhile, an unmarked scion of a dragonmarked house might suddenly display one against all expectations.

Siberys marks are mighty, unpredictable, and rare, and the dragonmarked houses keep a careful eye on anyone who manifests one. If its power can serve the house, fine — but an heir of Siberys who doesn’t conceal the dragonmark’s ability or remain firmly aligned with the dragonmarked house is likely to become the target of assassins.

You gain the following benefits.

Ability Score Increase: Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 30.

Aberrant Magic: Choose a level 8 or lower spell from the Sorcerer spell list or a spell from the Siberys Dragonmark Spells table (the table includes dragonmark suggestions if you’d like to associate a spell with one of the marks). You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot or spell components, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
	• Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you gain this feat).

    <description>The Boromar Clan

The Boromar Clan is the most powerful criminal organization in Sharn, with a reach that includes the city council, the Sharn Watch, House Jorasco, the elite social circles of Skyway, the shipping trade, and a wide array of illegal activity to boot — particularly extortion, gambling, smuggling, and thievery. The clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains, and its headquarters and key holdings lie in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, where many such migrants dwell.

Goals of the Boromar Clan.

For generations, the goals of the Boromar Clan have been simple: to maintain an iron grip on shady and illegal activities in Sharn. The Boromars extend their influence into places of power and bribe offi­cials of the Sharn Watch, all to maximize profits and power. Short-term goals come and go in service of these overarching objectives — blackmailing a councilor here, purchasing a shipping company there. But with the rise of Daask, the Boromars have the new and urgent goal of eliminating their upstart rival once and for all.

The fierce enmity between the Boromar Clan and Daask creates interesting options for inquisitive characters who stand (at least nominally) on the side of the law against both criminal organizations. Will they accept help from the Boromars against the much more obviously dangerous Daask? Or might they disregard Daask operations clearly meant to undermine the Boromars? The inquisitives might even «nd a way to ensure the conflict between the two criminal groups weakens them both, making Sharn safer in the process.

A Boromar Clan Arc.

The conflict between inquisitives and The Boromar Clan might follow this broad outline.
	• Levels 1–4. The characters investigate petty crimes — pickpocketing, burglary, blackmail, and such — and help bring several Boromar Clan members to justice. The inquisitives find the Sharn Watch unhelpful in dealing with these criminals, though, and some legitimate businesses and law-abiding citizens start shunning or insulting the characters, angry at their interference with the “hometown heroes” of the Boromar Clan.
	• Levels 5–10. Ostensibly trying to mend the poor relationship between the Sharn Watch and the inquisitives, a Watch o­fficer recruits the characters to bring a Daask gang to justice. The Watch helps, and the characters catch several Daask criminals. However, the characters’ Watch allies don’t seem concerned about whether any Daask members are hurt or killed in the final confrontation. Indeed, it turns out that the Boromar Clan arranged the operation to remove a dangerous group of rivals.
	• Levels 11–16. Boromar leaders try to recruit the characters to their side, offering exorbitant fees and extravagant gifts as payment for simple jobs. If bribery doesn’t work, the gang tries to coerce the characters into helping them, using friends, family members, or contacts as leverage. Along the way, the characters learn that a trusted NPC ally is firmly in the pocket of the Boromar Clan.
	• Levels 17–20. Assuming the characters haven’t joined the Boromars, the clan leadership tries to eliminate them. The Boromars can’t muster a physical threat to challenge characters of this level, so they wield their political power instead. Under pressure from Boromar leaders, the city council declares the adventurers a threat to Sharn’s safety and security. O­fficials revoke their inquisitive agency’s operations permit and ask the characters to leave Sharn.

Boromar Operatives.

The Boromar Clan began as a single family of halflings. Though its influence has expanded widely, its key operatives are still family members. Boromar operatives prefer deception and bribery over outright violence, though they defend their interests when necessary. Besides those described here, other Boromar operatives include bandits, commoners, spies, toughs, and warriors.

Boromar Smuggler.
Smugglers employed by the Boromar Clan (mostly halflings) are notoriously hard to catch. These speedy criminals tra­c everything from narcotics to illegal arcane
weaponry across Sharn.

Boromar Underboss.
Underbosses supervise larger clan operations, such as gambling halls and warehouses of smuggled goods awaiting transport. Accustomed to the criminal lifestyle,
these hardy individuals (mostly halflings) dismiss and dispose of threats with calculated ease.

    <description>Daask
	
Daask is a violent gang of muggers, extortionists, looters, cultists, and drug dealers supported by such monsters as harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, and trolls. It seems like a simple criminal gang engaged in a battle for territory and power against the Boromar Clan and the forces of law and order — but the truth is more complicated. In fact, the members of Daask take their orders from Sora Katra, one of the three hags (the Daughters of Sora Kell) who rule the nation of Droaam. Daask’s operations in Sharn are only a small part of a much larger scheme.

Goals of Daask.

The goals of Daask, like those of the Daughters of Sora Kell, are shrouded in mystery. As described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, the reason for Daask’s existence depends on the path you choose for the Daughters of Sora Kell — whether they seek peace and stability for their young nation of mistrusted monsters, desire to end humanity’s dominance over Khorvaire and let monsters rule, or merely follow the visions of Sora Teraza wherever they lead. Regardless of Daask’s larger purpose, however, one immediate goal remains: to eliminate the Boromar Clan, or at least break its hold on Sharn’s criminal underworld. Its methods range from street violence — mugging, armed robbery, and even pillaging — to extortion and trade in drugs.

A Daask Arc.

The conflict between inquisitives and Daask might follow this broad outline.
	• Levels 1–4. The characters investigate crimes perpetrated by Daask against businesses they eventually discover are a­ffiliated with the Boromar Clan. The Sharn Watch might hire the characters to help bring a Daask gang to justice, but the inquisitives eventually learn that the Boromar Clan seeks to use the Watch and the characters to strike back at Daask.
	• Levels 5–10. What seems like a routine case of a wealthy noble disappearing into a drug den while looking for thrills leads the characters to dig into Daask’s trade in dragon’s blood, a mysterious and dangerous new drug. The investigation drives the characters into conflict with increasingly powerful monsters affi­liated with the gang.
	• Levels 11–16. Daask operatives kidnap a prominent figure in Sharn, but the freed “victim” turns out to be a doppelganger. The characters are hired to retrieve the real victim, who is undergoing a ritual that will eventually transform them into a hag.
	• Levels 17–20. While Daask stirs up riots in the Cogs and Malleon’s Gate, the characters discover that the gang has also planted arcane explosives across the city. The characters must find the explosives before Sharn is thrown into utter chaos.

Daask Enforcers.

Daask’s agents in Sharn include changelings, goblins, humans, and shifters recruited in the city, as well as monsters that have come to Sharn from Droaam: gnolls, harpies, medusas,
minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and an oni leader named Cavallah. Droaam’s gnolls are untainted by the demonic influence of Yeenoghu; many such enforcers use the stat blocks presented here.

Daask Bruiser.
Intimidating and powerful, bruisers lead Daask operations when more violent and decisive shows of force are needed. These enforcers relish the brutality of their work.

Regardless of Daask’s larger purpose, however, one immediate goal remains: to eliminate the Boromar Clan, or at least break its hold on Sharn’s criminal underworld. Its methods range from street violence — mugging, armed robbery, and even pillaging — to extortion and trade in drugs.

A Daask Arc.

The conflict between inquisitives and Daask might follow this broad outline.
	• Levels 1–4. The characters investigate crimes perpetrated by Daask against businesses they eventually discover are a­ffiliated with the Boromar Clan. The Sharn Watch might hire the characters to help bring a Daask gang to justice, but the inquisitives eventually learn that the Boromar Clan seeks to use the Watch and the characters to strike back at Daask.
	• Levels 5–10. What seems like a routine case of a wealthy noble disappearing into a drug den while looking for thrills leads the characters to dig into Daask’s trade in dragon’s blood, a mysterious and dangerous new drug. The investigation drives the characters into conflict with increasingly powerful monsters affi­liated with the gang.
	• Levels 11–16. Daask operatives kidnap a prominent figure in Sharn, but the freed “victim” turns out to be a doppelganger. The characters are hired to retrieve the real victim, who is undergoing a ritual that will eventually transform them into a hag.
	• Levels 17–20. While Daask stirs up riots in the Cogs and Malleon’s Gate, the characters discover that the gang has also planted arcane explosives across the city. The characters must find the explosives before Sharn is thrown into utter chaos.

Daask Enforcers.

Daask’s agents in Sharn include changelings, goblins, humans, and shifters recruited in the city, as well as monsters that have come to Sharn from Droaam: gnolls, harpies, medusas,
minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and an oni leader named Cavallah. Droaam’s gnolls are untainted by the demonic influence of Yeenoghu; many such enforcers use the stat blocks presented here.

Daask Raider.
Raiders use guerrilla tactics to ambush warehouses and beat down opponents. These skilled fistfighters work in tandem to claim goods and territory for Daask.

    <description>The Dreaming Dark
	
The sinister and mysterious Dreaming Dark — a metaphysical force trying to prolong the current age of despair and violence — seeks to extend its reach toward Khorvaire. Over a century ago, the Dream Dark compromised House Deneith’s enclave in Upper Tavick’s Landing. Although the enclave seems normal to outsiders, and even to many in House Deneith, it is now a stronghold of shadows. Under the tutelage of the Dreaming Dark, the Sharn Deneith have become masters of intrigue and subtlety. They carefully conceal their psionic power from outsiders while using it to gather information from the wealthy citizens they ostensibly guard.

While the enclave serves the Dreaming Dark, most of its members have no idea they are in league with the Inspired. Over a century of indoctrination, the Inspired dominator Tirashana has taught the Sharn Deneith to see themselves as superior because of their dragonmarks and raised above the other dragonmarked houses by their psionic abilities. Even members of the house who work directly with the Inspired believe that the Inspired consider them equal partners, but in fact the Inspired view them merely as useful pawns. Now quori spirits have possessed fifteen members of the house.

In addition to the leaders of House Deneith in Sharn, the Dreaming Dark has agents strategically planted throughout the City of Towers. They include one member of the Sharn Council (Bestan ir’Tonn, who also has close ties to the Boromar Clan) and a leader in the Sharn Watch (Warden Maira ir’Talan of the Blackened Book). The Dreaming Dark also commands the allegiance of the Riedran ambassadors in Sharn.

Goals of the Dreaming Dark.

Building from the description in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, the Dream Dark has three objectives in the City of Towers:
	• To cause chaos and strife by undermining what little faith in law enforcement exists in Sharn — turning the forces of law and order against one another, fueling the feuds between criminal organizations, and spreading fear among the populace.
	• To promote their chosen champions, which in Sharn means the subverted and possessed agents of House Deneith.
	• To undermine the kalashtar throughout the city — especially in the Overlook district of Upper Dura and its Path of Light temple.

A Dreaming Dark Arc.

The Dream Dark poses a significant threat, which might not manifest fully until the characters can handle the danger. The conflict could play out according to this outline.
	• Levels 1–4. Early in their adventures, the inquisitives have vivid dreams that reveal key details about cases they’re working on — easily interpreted as subconscious insights bringing overlooked information to light. (The discussion of the Dreaming Dark in Eberron: Rising from the Last War includes suggestions for incorporating dreams into your game.)
	• Levels 5–10. Investigating a series of grisly crimes, the characters are aided by a Sentinel Marshal of House Deneith. When captured, the criminal insists that recurring dreams led to the crimes. The Sentinel Marshal dismisses this claim. If the inquisitives investigate further, they find themselves drawn into a nightmare scenario involving a quori. In the course of that adventure, they glean clues that the Sentinel Marshal played a more sinister part in events than previously suspected.
	• Levels 11–16. The characters experience increasingly frequent nightmares, individually and as a group. Meanwhile, the Sentinel Marshals and other members of House Deneith interfere with their investigations.
	• Levels 17–20. The inquisitives uncover the corruption at the heart of the House Deneith enclave in Sharn, which reaches all the way to its lord, Sadran d’Deneith — a human man possessed by a powerful quori spirit. Their investigations lead to confrontations with Deneith leaders in the waking world, but eventually the inquisitives must fight the quori in the dream world of Dal Quor.
	
Dreaming Dark Agents.

Anyone can be seduced into the service of the Dream Dark, and a normal person possessed by a quori (see the quori stat blocks in Eberron: Rising from the Last War) uses their normal stat block. The two agents presented here are Inspired agents of the Dark who wield terrifying psionic power.

Dreaming Dark Infiltrator.
Dreaming Dark infiltrators are spies sent to gather intelligence. They plant psychic seeds in their minds of their foes that enhance the infiltrators’ combat prowess against those enemies.

    <description>House Tarkanan
	
House Tarkanan is a criminal gang in Sharn, founded when Thora Tavin assembled the survivors of a suicide squad of Brelish spies who bore aberrant dragonmarks. She adopted the surname of Lord Halas Tarkanan, who used his aberrant dragonmark to wreak havoc in Sharn during the War of the Mark, and fashioned this group of thieves and assassins into a mockery of the dragonmarked houses. However, the gang lacks the recognition, power, and resources of the actual houses.

Goals of House Tarkanan.

House Tarkanan is a gang of thieves and assassins operating within the city of Sharn, but its name points to its founder’s vision for building the gang into a larger movement. Most members have no higher aspirations than using their aberrant dragonmarks to profit from a criminal lifestyle. But the gang’s leaders seek to amplify their dragonmarks’ power to the worldshaking level of the aberrant champions of the War of the Mark, Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague. With such awesome power at their disposal, they plan to reawaken the ancient conflict over aberrant dragonmarks and topple the dragonmarked houses from their position of power.

Thora Tarkanan (still known about town under her original name, Thora Tavin), who founded the gang, recently stepped aside from its leadership, ceding power to a mysterious figure called the Son of Khyber. Little is known about him, but he bears the strongest aberrant mark seen in modern times along with the skills of a military commander. Some call him Halas Tarkanan born again, believing he is mustering an aberrant army to lead into battle against the dragonmarked houses. Thora remains the Son of Khyber’s second-in-command and the public face of the gang.

A House Tarkanan Arc.

The conflict between adventurers and House Tarkanan might follow this broad outline.
	• Levels 1–4. A patron asks the characters to get involved in a criminal investigation into a rash of murders in Sharn because all the victims have dragonmarks. Both the Sharn Watch and one or more private inquisitives already squabble over access to evidence and witnesses — the characters’ attempt to get involved merely heightens the tension. The perpetrators turn out to be members of House Tarkanan, whom the characters must bring to justice.
	• Levels 5–10. After the characters’ success in dealing with the Tarkanan killers, the Watch comes to them for additional help. Petty thieves belonging to the gang have offered inside information into House Tarkanan’s plans in exchange for leniency in their sentencing. These thieves don’t share their leaders’ delusions of grandeur or hatred of the dragonmarked houses. The information points to a gathering of aberrant heirs deep below Sharn.
	• Levels 11–16. After the characters disrupt House Tarkanan’s schemes in the depths of Sharn, the gang sends powerful assassins with fearsome aberrant dragonmarks after the party.
	• Levels 17–20. The Son of Khyber leads a small army of aberrant-marked warriors and assassins to challenge the leadership of Sharn — and plots to conjure a Blob of Annihilation to level the city’s skyscraping towers.

Aberrant Heirs.

House Tarkanan incorporates members with a wide variety of aberrant dragonmarks. Any Humanoid in the Monster Manual or another source could be a House Tarkanan agent with a mark that doesn’t affect the creature’s use in combat or that is re¬ected in the creature’s existing abilities. For example, a Vampire Familiar might gain its unique abilities from an aberrant mark rather than from any connection to a vampire, and a Bandit Deceiver ’s spellcasting could derive from such a mark. On the other hand, an ordinary Bandit or Tough might have an aberrant mark that allows the NPC to cast Disguise Self, Silent Image, or a similar spell with little impact on the NPC’s combat abilities.

The two stat blocks presented here, along with the Tarkanan Assassin in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, illustrate members of House Tarkanan who wield the power of their aberrant marks in combat.

    <description>The Khoravar dragonmarked scions of House Lyrandar include swashbuckling sky captains, seafaring adventurers, and sinister cultists of the Hurricane Harvest. The power of their dragonmarks manifests as easy control of wind, thunder, and lightning, which they wield as readily in combat as in navigating the sea and sky.

Members of the Hurricane Harvest believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of the Sovereign Host, as others in their house teach, but the sign of the Devourer. They maintain that the greatest ancestors of their house live on as krakens in the deep and guide the cult through visions to use their power for destruction and domination. They sometimes partner with kuo-toa, sahuagin, and other monsters of the deep.

	<description>The Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith, who are typically human, hold the honor of the house in their hands. The Treaty of Thronehold upheld their authority to pursue criminals across international borders, giving them the unique privilege and responsibility of upholding the law across Khorvaire.

Only the most trusted heirs of the house are honored with a position in the Sentinel Marshals, either after serving in the house's other guilds for several years (as bodyguards in the Defenders Guild and mercenary officers in the Blademarks Guild) or by special dispensation of House Deneith.

Sentinel Marshals are never authorized to break local or international laws, but neither are they accountable to the legal authorities of any nation. A rogue marshal can be punished only by the leadership of House Deneith, but some nations (such as Darguun and Droaam) ignore these conventions.

Even though House Phiarlan agents don't typically work as entertainers or artists in addition to their espionage activities, they receive extensive training in those arts alongside other members of their house. House Thuranni agents, in contrast, are always both artists and spies.

Tharashk hunters, typically humans or orcs, often work alongside Druids of the Gatekeepers, and occasionally with Aberrant Cultists of the Dragon Below.

    <description>Order of the Emerald Claw
	
Driven by fanatical evil and bolstered by legions of undead soldiers, the Order of the Emerald Claw is a villainous organization whose aims often pit its agents against expeditions from Morgrave University. The order’s methods range from military raids using undead soldiers to subtle espionage and assassination.

Goals of the Emerald Claw.

In service of its undead leader, Lady Illmarrow, the Order of the Emerald Claw seeks powerful magic items, particularly those created with necromantic magic. Often its agents use these items simply to spread terror and destruction, but their efforts ultimately support Lady Illmarrow’s goal of reactivating her dragonmark, the extinct Mark of Death.

An Emerald Claw Arc.
	
The conflict between adventurers and the Order of the Emerald Claw might follow this broad outline.
	• Levels 1–4. At low levels, the characters can clash with skeletons and zombies under the Emerald Claw’s control. At the same time, they might build a relationship — professional or personal — with an Emerald Claw spy within the Morgrave University faculty, such as Dala Arand (see the “Cyre Tower” section later in this chapter). This spy could even serve as a patron for the characters’ expeditions.
	• Levels 5–10. Emerald Claw agents use violence to keep the characters away from treasures the order has claimed. The adventurers might set out explicitly to prevent the Emerald Claw from acquiring powerful magic, or the two groups might be searching for the same sites and treasures. But the Claw agents seem to have inside information on the characters’ activities and plans!
	• Levels 11–16. The spy at Morgrave University is uncovered and emerges as a powerful villain — perhaps a mighty necromancer or a vampire — who takes center stage through middle to high levels. Now the Emerald Claw primarily works to get the adventurers out of the way so they can’t foil Lady Illmarrow’s greater schemes.
	• Levels 17–20. The characters or the Emerald Claw agents acquire information about the Mark of Death, attracting Lady Illmarrow’s attention. The would-be Queen of the Dead plans an elaborate ritual in the heart of Shae Mordai, the elven City of the Dead. The rite will destroy the islands of Aerenal and elevate Lady Illmarrow to divinity — unless the characters stop her first.
	
Emerald Claw Agents.

Agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw are soldiers whose obedience to the order and their superiors is absolute. They include the scouts, spies, and warriors, in addition to the stat blocks presented here, and they are often accompanied by Undead troops such as Skeletons, Zombies, and Karrnathi Undead Soldiers. Their leaders include Bone Knights.

Emerald Claw Commander.
Emerald Claw commanders lead large groups of soldiers, inspiring the fanatical devotion of Humanoids and Undead alike.

    <description>Drow of Xen’drik

Within the cyclopean ruins of Xen’drik, drow are the self-proclaimed inheritors of the Age of Giants. The descendants of elves who were enslaved by giants, drow now dwell in the homes of their former masters, guarding the relics and holy sites that fate has entrusted to them. With a culture based on rebellion, magic, and combat prowess, drow are deadly enemies to any who would attempt to steal or debase the history of Xen’drik.

Most drow of Xen’drik worship a fierce scorpion-god called Vulkoor. Some theologians of the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six believe Vulkoor to be an aspect of the Mockery (see Eberron: Rising from the Last War), but the Vulkoori drow show no partiality to the followers of the Mockery or any other god but their own. In imitation of their arachnid god, Vulkoori wear plates of scorpion chitin sewn to leather straps and sheaths. They tattoo their flesh using scorpion venom that leaves white scars on their skin.

Vulkoori Stingblade.
Vulkoori drow warriors coat their weapons with the same deadly scorpion venom they use to tattoo their skin. Thanks to their extensive use of poison, they are resistant to the scorpion venom’s full effects.

	<description>Drow of Xen’drik

Within the cyclopean ruins of Xen’drik, drow are the self-proclaimed inheritors of the Age of Giants. The descendants of elves who were enslaved by giants, drow now dwell in the homes of their former masters, guarding the relics and holy sites that fate has entrusted to them. With a culture based on rebellion, magic, and combat prowess, drow are deadly enemies to any who would attempt to steal or debase the history of Xen’drik.

Most drow of Xen’drik worship a fierce scorpion-god called Vulkoor. Some theologians of the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six believe Vulkoor to be an aspect of the Mockery (see Eberron: Rising from the Last War), but the Vulkoori drow show no partiality to the followers of the Mockery or any other god but their own. In imitation of their arachnid god, Vulkoori wear plates of scorpion chitin sewn to leather straps and sheaths. They tattoo their flesh using scorpion venom that leaves white scars on their skin.

Umbragen Shadow Walker.
Umbragen drow are the descendants of drow who fled the giants and found refuge underground. For countless generations, they have lived in the lightless caverns of Khyber. There, they tapped into a mysterious magical shadow they called the Umbra. Though some have emerged to haunt the surface in the wake of the giant empire's fall, they retain a spiritual and physical connection to the darkness below. Umbragen shadow walkers weave shadow magic to confound foes.

    <text>This prosthetic appendage was developed by artificers of House Cannith. To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the prosthetic magically forms a copy of the appendage it's replacing.

While attached, the prosthetic provides these benefits:

	• The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body.
	• You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can't be removed against your will.
	• The prosthetic is a magic melee weapon with which you're proficient. It deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the prosthetic detaches and flies at the target of the attack, then immediately returns to you and reattaches.

Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

To attune to this item, you must wear it on your head for the entire attunement period, during which the crown's hidden tendrils burrow into your scalp to bond with your skull.

While wearing the crown, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

Spells: The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 16): charm person (1 charge), disintegrate (6 charges), fear (3 charges), finger of death (7 charges), flesh to stone (6 charges), hold person (2 charges), ray of enfeeblement (2 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (3 charges), telekinesis (5 charges).

The crown regains 1d6+3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Symbiotic Nature: The crown can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the crown ends, and it detaches from you.

The daelkyr Belashyrra made these crowns. While on the same plane of existence as the crown, Belashyrra can see through its eyestalks.

    <text>A dimensional seal is a massive stone slab covered with a complex pattern of runes and sigils. The seal projects an invisible field with a radius of two miles. This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. It also negates the effects of any manifest zone within the field.

Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches, as relics of the conflict between the Gatekeeper druids and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be serious consequences for the world.

    <text>A docent is a small metal sphere, about 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. To attune to a docent, you must embed the item somewhere on your body, such as your chest or your eye socket.

Sentience:
A docent is a sentient item of any alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It perceives the world through your senses. It communicates telepathically with you and can speak, read, and understand any language it knows (see "Random Properties" below).

Life Support:
Whenever you end your turn with 0 hit points, the docent can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check with a +6 bonus. If this check succeeds, the docent stabilizes you.

Random Properties:
A docent has the following properties:

Languages:
The docent knows Common, Giant, and 1d4 additional languages chosen by the DM. If a docent knows fewer than six languages, it can learn a new language after it hears or reads the language through your senses.

Skills:
The docent has a +7 bonus to one of the following skills (roll a d4): (1) Arcana, (2) History, (3) Investigation, or (4) Nature.

Spells:
The docent knows one of the following spells and can cast it at will, requiring no components (roll a d6): (1–2) detect evil and good or (3–6) detect magic. The docent decides when to cast the spell.

Personality:
A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent, it might refuse to assist you.

    <text>A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. If you're a warforged, you can attune to the docent, at which point the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life | literally.

A docent is an intelligent magic item designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. A typical docent has an Intelligence score of 16 and Wisdom and Charisma scores of 14. Once you're attuned to the docent, it can communicate with you telepathically and can perceive the world through your senses. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elven and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen'drik may have never encountered a dwarf before… but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarven language.

In addition, a docent possesses up to three of the following traits.

	• Can cast detect magic at will
	• Can cast detect evil and good at will
	• Can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting the warforged host.
	• Intelligence (Arcana) +7
	• Intelligence (History) +7
	• Intelligence (Investigation) +7
	• Intelligence (Nature) +7
	• Wisdom (Insight) +6
	• Wisdom (Perception) +6

The docent can make Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host, with a +7 bonus. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.

You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its traits on your behalf. In the case of skills, this uses the docent's bonus; your abilities and proficiencies have no effect on the outcome. These traits are under the control of the docent, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you… or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.

The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the first warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen'drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators… but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen'drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it's possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.

In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a fireball in a crowded street.

    <text>A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, but attack rolls made against aberrations with this weapon have disadvantage. A creature hit by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 psychic damage. When you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll with this weapon, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As a bonus action, you can sheathe the whip by causing it to retract into your arm, or draw the whip out of your arm again.

Symbiotic Nature: The whip can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the whip ends, and it detaches from you.

Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

Reach: This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.

In their raw form, Eberron shards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing their depths.

Eberron shards are the most common form of dragonshard. They are primarily refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise. Dragonshard dust is used in the creation of magic items, and many powerful tools | such as the lightning rail and elemental airships | require an ongoing expenditure of Eberron dragonshards to maintain their enchantments.

While wearing the clothing, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to transform your outfit into your choice of one of the other designs contained within it. Regardless of its appearance, the outfit can't be anything but clothing. Although it can duplicate the look of other magical clothing, it doesn't gain their magical properties.

    <text>The key to long-distance, virtually instantaneous communication across Khorvaire is House Sivis's network of message stations. Each station contains at least one speaking stone, which is carved from a Siberys dragonshard and inscribed with arcane symbols that uniquely identify it. If you're a gnome with the Mark of Scribing, you can touch the stone and use an action to cast the sending spell from it. The target is any other speaking stone whose location or unique sequence of symbols you know. A creature within 5 feet of the stone hears the message as if they were the target.

In a Sivis message station, a gnome is always on duty by the speaking stone, listening for messages that might come in and transcribing them for delivery to their intended recipients.

    <text>This device creates an antimagic field that covers a three-mile radius around the spell sink. The form that it takes will depend on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, and if they create a spell sink it will be a living artifact | a twisted tree that consumes the mystical energies around it. Conversely, a mad artificer would create a massive vessel of dragonshards and exotic metals. It might be that the sole purpose of the device is to negate magic, or it could be that it is absorbing all magical energies in the area and storing that power for a cataclysmic effect!

    <text>This polished Eberron dragonshard fits in the hand and stores information similar to a book. The shard can hold the equivalent of one book that's no more than 320 pages long. A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within.

While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank "pages" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it.

A wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and time to "scribe" a spell into the shard.

    <text>These metallic nodules were created in response to the poisonous gases used on the battlefields of the Last War. When you attune to these lungs, they replace the lungs in your chest, which disappear. The lungs allow you to breathe normally, even in an antimagic field, and their breathing function can't be suppressed by magic.

Outside an antimagic field or any other effect that suppresses magic, these lungs allow you to breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum), and you have advantage on saving throws against harmful gases such as those created by a cloudkill spell, a stinking cloud spell, inhaled poisons, and gaseous breath weapons.

As an action, you can use these lungs to exhale a gust of wind, as if you had cast the gust of wind spell (spell save DC 15) with no components. This property of the lungs can't be used again until the next dawn.

If your attunement to the lungs ends, your original lungs reappear.

If a sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.

    <text>The double scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over tens of thousands of years, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double scimitar is an expensive weapon, but few people ever have an opportunity to purchase one. If you're an elf, your blade could have a long and storied history. If you're not an elf, you might have stolen the weapon from a fallen foe or received it from a dying Valenar ally. If you work with your DM to create the story behind your double scimitar, you can start with the weapon at 1st level in place of a martial weapon normally granted by your class. However, it can be dangerous for a non-elf to carry a double scimitar. Valenar may demand its return or challenge you to prove that you're worthy to wield it.

Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

Two-Handed: This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>
While within the Citadel of Lidless Eyes, Belashyrra can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Belashyrra can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of Belashyrra. One random eye ray of Belashyrra's shoots from that eye at a target of Belashyrra's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and disappears.

	• Belashyrra creates a wave of madness. Each creature it can see within its lair must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, a creature must use its action at the start of its turn before moving to make a melee attack against another creature of Belashyrra's choice within reach. If there are no creatures within reach, the charmed creature can act normally for that turn. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

	• Belashyrra taps into the eyesight of creatures in its lair and alters their perception. Each creature of Belashyrra's choice in the lair must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the affected creature perceives objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations, imposing disadvantage on the creature's attack rolls against those targets. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this lair action for the next 24 hours.</text>

      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>
Belashyrra's lair is known to touch remote areas of the Shadow Marches and caverns below Xen'drik. A region containing a passage to Belashyrra's lair is warped by its magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

	• Creatures within 1 mile of the passage sometimes feel as if they're being watched.

	• Beasts that live within 5 miles of the passage undergo magical transmutation, growing eyes or eyestalks that Belashyrra can see through.

	• A humanoid who spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see "Madness of Belashyrra" below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

If Belashyrra dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Dreadful Visions. The madness of Belashyrra is tied to sight: images that can't be unseen, horrific hallucinations, the fear of blindness and of being watched—or realizing that something else is using your eyes. Belashyrra can force its victims to question whether what they perceive is real, or can fill their world with such terrors that they willingly blind themselves to escape.

Belashyrra sees mortals as raw materials to be exploited or insects to be exterminated. However, the Lord of Eyes has been known to take an interest in specific mortals. Belashyrra's warlocks serve as its envoys in the world and are often directed to seek out creatures and sites that the daelkyr wishes to see through their eyes.

Belashyrra's Cults. The Lord of Eyes has followers across Khorvaire, and its cults are typically driven by mad visions. Devoted cultists can grow eyes in unusual locations, and might have darkvision or other supernatural abilities when they view the world through those eyes. Beholderkin often advise or lead Belashyrra's cults, and cultists typically treat these aberrations as divine beings.

Belashyrra's Lair:
Belashyrra makes its lair in the Citadel of Lidless Eyes deep in Khyber, a site that appears to have been molded from molten stone, chitin, and flesh. Across its warped and liquid expanses, thousands of eyes of every size and shape peer into the endless darkness. Beholders, dolgrims, and stranger aberrations dwell within the halls of the citadel, which is one of the few places where such creatures are willing to live side by side.

Some beholderkin serve Belashyrra as guards and agents, while others spend their lives in deep meditation, pursuing inner visions known only to the Lord of Eyes. It's rumored that anyone who sits on the citadel's throne can see through the eyes of any sentient creature on Eberron or in Khyber. If encountered in its lair, Belashyrra has a challenge rating of 23 (50,000 XP).

Madness of Belashyrra:
If a creature goes mad in Belashyrra's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Belashyrra table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured. Chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide has more information on madness.

Madness of Belashyrra:
d6 | Flaw (lasts until cured)
1 | "I constantly see shapes moving in the shadows."
2 | "I perceive certain types of people—vocations or entire societies—as hideous monsters."
3 | "Someone is watching everything I do."
4 | "When I close my eyes, I see my past misdeeds."
5 | "I don't trust my sight. I have no idea what's real and what's a hallucination."
6 | "Something watches the world through my eyes. To thwart them, I keep my eyes closed or covered."

Early in the Last War, Karrnath turned to the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to bolster the nation's army with undead forces. The skeletons and zombies created by the necromancers were mindless creatures that required guidance. The first bone knights were appointed to provide this control.

Devoted paladins of the Blood of Vol were fused into suits of bonecraft armor, whose magic focused their divine gifts, allowing them to command units of mindless undead. Bonecraft armor can't be removed without killing the knight who wears it, and when donning it, each bone knight understood that their former life was over.

The Fall of the Emerald Claw. During the Last War, many bone knights took service with the Order of the Emerald Claw, helping that name strike fear into the enemies of Karrnath. In the last decade, King Kaius III of Karrnath has done much to ensure a peaceful end to the Last War. Under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, Kaius sealed most of Karrnath's undead in deep vaults, and the Order of the Emerald Claw was disbanded. A few bone knights remained in service to the crown, but most were cast aside—still bound to their bonecraft armor and still convinced of Karrnathi supremacy. These bone knights felt that Kaius had betrayed both them and their nation, leading their once-proud order to find a new purpose in the service of Lady Illmarrow.

    <description>Changelings are a humanoid race of shapechangers who conceal their true identities behind false faces. Their gifts of mimicry allow them to appear as members of any humanoid culture, playing the part of a dwarf one day and a dragonborn the next. Although changelings can adopt any guise, most rely on a few established personas, each with a developed history and a network of friends and acquaintances.

    <description>Dolgaunts are emaciated hobgoblins with disease-hued flesh. Their eye sockets gape open and empty above a mouth with a wormlike tongue. Writhing cilia cover their bodies, with longer tendrils around their heads and two wiry tentacles protruding from their bare shoulders. A dolgaunt is blind but can perceive its surroundings through the sensitive cilia that cover its skin. It can also absorb life through its tentacles, allowing it to drain the vitality out of any creature it touches.

Warped by Chaos:
When the daelkyr emerged from Xoriat to conquer Khorvaire, they captured and transformed that land's indigenous creatures to create armies of hideous warriors. Dyrrn the Corruptor shaped dolgaunts from hobgoblin stock, turning them into intelligent, cold, and efficient killers.

When the daelkyr were defeated, the dolgaunts descended into the depths of Khyber with their masters. There, they study in cavernous monasteries, forging their bodies into living weapons dedicated to the missions given them by those masters. Dolgaunts are often found commanding squads of dolgrims, and can also be found working with the Cults of the Dragon Below—particularly those devoted to Dyrrn the Corruptor.

    <description>Dolgrims are squat, deformed things. Warped by the daelkyr, a dolgrim is essentially two goblins crushed into one creature, their misshapen body boasting four arms and a pair of twisted mouths that gibber and slather at the front of a headless torso. The two mouths of a dolgrim sometimes carry on demented conversations with one another. However, a dolgrim has only a single personality—sadistic, bloodthirsty, and brutally dedicated to serving itself.

Small numbers of these creatures sometimes make their way to the surface, often under the command of dolgaunts, and undertaking missions advancing the inscrutable schemes of their malevolent masters. But great hordes of dolgrims remain clustered in Khyber with the daelkyr, dreaming of the day when they will be released into Eberron to feast and destroy.

    <description>Dusk hags resemble gnarled crones with shriveled orange skin, tangled gray hair, and eyes that burn like hot coals. They see visions of the future in their dreams, and their dark magic allows them to influence the dreams of others, sending messages or inflicting nightmares with a touch. Tales talk of ambitious wizards, frantic monarchs, and desperate heroes undertaking quests or making bargains with a dusk hag in exchange for its prophecies and visions of the future. But the information gained from a dusk hag often has a way of causing more pain than joy. Like all hags, dusk hags enjoy causing strife to those who bargain with them, and find ways to twist and turn promises to their own advantage. The Dusk Hag Prophecies table provides examples of the sort of dreams dusk hags might share with unsuspecting sleepers.

Dusk Hag Prophecies:
d10 | Prophecy
1 | "A red hat approaches with ill intent. Be wary."
2 | "A ship comes on a sea of bones, but treasure waits behind a silver skull."
3 | "Three days, three deaths, three eyes, three breaths."
4 | "Doom falls on the peacock and the sparrow alike. Best be a raven."
5 | "A white hand on a black field holds the golden key."
6 | "Beware the black horse."
7 | "The fish is your friend."
8 | "The stairs downward lead to that which you seek."
9 | "Look for two crossed swords. There your goal lies."
10 | "If you see two crows, turn back. Beyond is death."

Dyrrn magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or take 30 (5d8+8) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

      <name>Lair Actions</name>
      <text>
While within the Palace of Sinew, Dyrrn can invoke the ambient magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Dyrrn can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

	• Dyrrn uses its Corruption action.

	• A 30-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of Dyrrn sprouts tentacles until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that starts or ends its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A creature can escape the tentacles with a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action.

	• Each creature of Dyrrn's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) psychic damage.

Unless the target has immunity to psychic damage, its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4 each time it fails the saving throw for this lair action. The target dies if its Intelligence score is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.</text>

    <legendary>
      <name>Regional Effects</name>
      <text>
A region containing a passage to Dyrrn's lair is warped in one or more of these ways:

	• Plants and animals raised within 2 mile of the passage have twisted, aberrant forms. Use the Daelkyr Modifications table for inspiration.

	• Creatures within 1 mile of the passage frequently feel as if something is crawling under their skin.

	• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the passage, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a type of madness (see "Madness of Dyrrn" below). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

If Dyrrn dies, these effects fade away after 1d10 days.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Twisting Flesh and Thought. The mind flayers of Eberron know Dyrrn as the Overmind, and it serves as the cornerstone of their collective consciousness. Of all the daelkyr, the Corruptor is the most adept at twisting minds and bodies to create monsters. It was Dyrrn who turned goblinoid prisoners into the first dolgaunts and dolgrims, creating the legions that would savage the nations of Khorvaire. Dyrrn is also a prolific creator of symbionts—treasures that tempt people to bind alien entities to their flesh.

Dyrrn's Cults. Dyrrn's lair touches the Eldeen Reaches, and the druids of the Towering Wood are always watching for Dyrrn's influence. At the start of the Last War, the dwarves of the Mror Holds discovered passages to the daelkyr's realm below their halls, and Dyrrn's cults have spread from there.

Mind flayers often work with Dyrrn's cults, many of which are obsessed with evolution—through the use of symbionts or by becoming an aberration. Those who worship the Stealer of Thoughts believe that Dyrrn will consume all sentient beings, except for its servants.

Dyrrn most often appears as a tall humanoid male with pale skin, clad in a heavy cassock of interwoven black leather that slithers unsettlingly around the daelkyr's form. Dyrrn can extend tentacles from its body, using them to extract the brains of others.

Dyrrn's Lair:
Dyrrn makes its lair in the Palace of Sinew, a horrid site shaped from the leftover flesh and bones of the daelkyr's sculpting. The walls of the palace undulate as air flows through them, as if the space were breathing.

Madness of Dyrrn:
If a creature goes mad in Dyrrn's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Dyrrn table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured. Chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide has more information on madness.

Madness of Dyrrn:
d6 | Flaw (lasts until cured)
1 | "There's an illithid parasite living in my brain!"
2 | "I can feel myself evolving into an aberration."
3 | "Aberrations are the only natural things."
4 | "A part of me has become a conscious entity."
5 | "My opponents must bow down to a mind flayer!"
6 | "Dyrrn and the mind flayers simply want to unite all sentient creatures in collective consciousness. And I receive messages from the group mind!"

The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.

    <description>Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares—the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

    <description>The rulers of distant Sarlona are known as the Inspired. These noble families are said to be bound to celestial spirits that guide and empower them, but the truth is far darker. The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of Dal Quor, and they carry out the foul agenda of the Dreaming Dark.

Any humanoid who can dream can volunteer to serve as a quori vessel. But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can't resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.

Most of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedra—never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.

The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

    <description>Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares—the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

    <description>Undead soldiers form the elite core of the army of Karrnath. Fearless and tireless, they are a terrifying sight on the battlefield. With the end of the Last War, most Karrnathi undead have been sealed in vaults below the city of Atur. However, the Karrnathi army keeps numerous undead in its service, while others have been commandeered by the malevolent Order of the Emerald Claw.

The Odakyr Rites:
The nation of Karrnath has a proud martial heritage, and its soldiers are unmatched in discipline. But in the early years of the Last War, Karrnath was crippled by famine and plague. In desperation, King Kaius I embraced the Blood of Vol, whose priests bolstered the armies of Karrnath with undead.

Initially, those skeletons and zombies required constant control and served as cannon fodder. Over decades, a high priest named Malevanor worked with the necromancers of the Blood of Vol to develop the Odakyr Rites, which grant Karrnathi undead the ability to make tactical decisions and operate without direct guidance.

The Odakyr Rites work only when performed on the remains of a soldier slain in battle, and only in manifest zones tied to the plane of Mabar. The most significant such zones in Karrnath exist in the cities of Atur and Odakyr (now called Fort Bones). The number of Karrnathi undead soldiers steadily increased over the course of the war, with the losses of Karrnath's living troops offset by the recovery and raising of their remains.

Malevanor claimed that Karrnathi undead are animated and granted intelligence by the patriotic spirit of Karrnath. However, many Karrns fear that the undead are vessels for a darker power—and that Lady Illmarrow or someone else will turn the undead against the living.

Intelligent and Inhuman:
Karrnathi undead bear little resemblance to the people they were in life. These undead are content to stand motionless and silent for days. They show no emotion, and certainly no mercy or compassion. Undead soldiers kill any opposing forces—including civilians among those forces—unless given explicit instructions to the contrary.

A few exceptional Karrnathi undead retain their individuality and the memories of their former lives. Such undead are often found as champions of the Blood of Vol or agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw.

Undead Nature:
A Karrnathi undead soldier doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Lady Illmarrow is a legend—an ancient lich said to dwell in a castle of bone and ice in the coldest regions of the Lhazaar Principalities. Some stories say that she is served by a legion of undead and that she maintains a court of vampires and ghosts in her palace of ice. Other tales claim that when anyone dies in Lhazaar, Illmarrow chooses whether to take their soul before it passes on to the Keeper and Dolurrh.

But Lady Illmarrow is no folk tale. She is the greatest necromancer in Eberron, and after centuries of silence, she is setting ancient plots into motion at last. She is the power behind the Order of the Emerald Claw, but her motives for founding the order are buried in her past. Lady Illmarrow has no interest in ruling the living. Rather, she seeks to become Queen of the Dead.

The Mark of Death:
Illmarrow is a fiefdom on the isle of Farlnen—home to a community of elves exiled from Aerenal, who have practiced necromancy for centuries. But Lady Illmarrow's roots extend far beyond her island domain.

Long ago, it was revealed that the elven line of Vol—a house that practiced the art of necromancy and bore the Dragonmark of Death—was engaged in secret blood rites with a clan of dragons. The discovery of this pact triggered an unprecedented alliance between the Sibling Kings of Aerenal and the dragons of Argonnessen. The Sibling Kings proclaimed that House Vol would be exterminated to the last member, and the Mark of Death would be eliminated from the world.

The line of Vol had long been rivals of the Undying Court, and many whisper even today that the attack on House Vol was nothing more than an excuse to eliminate a political rival. But others believe that what the Undying Court truly feared was a path shown in the Draconic Prophecy—that a child born of dragon and elf could become a godlike avatar of death.

Illmarrow Rises:
Even as dragons and elves fought to destroy the line of Vol, a child was born to the house: Erandis. A scion of elf and dragon, Erandis bore a Mark of Death unlike any other. In time, it might have been her gateway to immortality and unrivaled power, but she was hunted down and killed long before she could master the mark's magic. Her mother, Minara Vol, escaped with her daughter's body to the icy reaches of Farlnen, far from the conflict. There, Minara unleashed all her necromantic power to raise Erandis as a lich.

As an undead being, Erandis lost the use of her dragonmark. Thus, when the diviners of Aerenal asked if the line of Vol had been exterminated and the Mark of Death destroyed, they received a vision affirming that the bloodline of Vol was no more. To the world, the last survivor of that bloodline is known as Lady Illmarrow. But in truth, she is Erandis Vol, heir to the Mark of Death.

Trapped in Undeath:
When Minara restored Erandis as a lich, she hid her daughter's phylactery, weaving enchantments into it that cause Erandis to be reborn in a random safe haven after she is destroyed. Thus, even Erandis herself doesn't know the location or form of her phylactery.

Restoring the Mark:
Though she takes great pleasure in fighting the dragons and elves who destroyed her ancestors, Lady Illmarrow has a more important goal: restoring her dragonmark and unlocking godlike powers. The agents of the Emerald Claw who serve her fight either for the good of Karrnath or for personal gain, but Illmarrow cares for nothing except increasing her necromantic knowledge and finding a way to restore her lost mark.

Lady Illmarrow and the Blood of Vol.
------
The Blood of Vol and Lady Illmarrow are both legacies of the line of Vol, but they aren't one and the same. As far as the world knows, the line of Vol was exterminated. Followers of the Blood of Vol who have heard of Lady Illmarrow believe that she's a champion of their faith, but they don't worship or serve her. And the powers of priests of the Blood of Vol don't come from Lady Illmarrow.

Of all the anomalies that emerged from the magical cataclysm that created the Mournland, the appearance of living spells might be the most mysterious. In some unknown fashion, the magical energy unleashed during the Last War caused spell effects to take on sentience. A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy endures indefinitely.

Living spells haunt the Mournland and other areas blasted by the Last War, somehow subsisting on ambient magical energy as they writhe and across the landscape. Though they have no need for sustenance, they attack any creatures they come into contact with, lashing out indiscriminately with their corrupted magic.

Customizing a Living Spell:
Living spells come in many varieties; the stat blocks here are three examples. Living spells most often manifest from evocation and conjuration spells. To make a living spell from a different spell, choose a damage-dealing evocation or conjuration spell from the wizard spell list of up to 5th level. Then consult the Living Spell Customization table to see which stat block to customize, based on the chosen spell's level.

Living Spell Customization:
Spell Level | Stat Block to Customize
1–2 | Living burning hands
3–4 | Living lightning bolt
5 | Living cloudkill

Now make the following changes to that stat block:

Damage Immunity:
Replace the living spell's damage immunity with immunity to the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

Magical Strike:
Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

Spell Mimicry:
Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell's Magical Strike.

For example, if you turn fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the living lightning bolt. The living fireball has immunity to fire damage, instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical Strike; and replicates fireball with Spell Mimicry.

Damage Immunity:
Replace the living spell's damage immunity with immunity to the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

Magical Strike:
Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

Spell Mimicry:
Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell's Magical Strike.

For example, if you turn fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the living lightning bolt. The living fireball has immunity to fire damage, instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical Strike; and replicates fireball with Spell Mimicry.

    <description>Constructed Nature. A living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Of all the anomalies that emerged from the magical cataclysm that created the Mournland, the appearance of living spells might be the most mysterious. In some unknown fashion, the magical energy unleashed during the Last War caused spell effects to take on sentience. A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy endures indefinitely.

Living spells haunt the Mournland and other areas blasted by the Last War, somehow subsisting on ambient magical energy as they writhe and across the landscape. Though they have no need for sustenance, they attack any creatures they come into contact with, lashing out indiscriminately with their corrupted magic.

Customizing a Living Spell:
Living spells come in many varieties; the stat blocks here are three examples. Living spells most often manifest from evocation and conjuration spells. To make a living spell from a different spell, choose a damage-dealing evocation or conjuration spell from the wizard spell list of up to 5th level. Then consult the Living Spell Customization table to see which stat block to customize, based on the chosen spell's level.

Living Spell Customization:
Spell Level | Stat Block to Customize
1–2 | Living burning hands
3–4 | Living lightning bolt
5 | Living cloudkill

Now make the following changes to that stat block:

Damage Immunity:
Replace the living spell's damage immunity with immunity to the type (or types) of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

Magical Strike:
Replace the damage that Magical Strike deals with one type of damage dealt by the chosen spell.

Spell Mimicry:
Replace the effect of Spell Mimicry with the effect of the chosen spell. If that spell requires a saving throw, use spell save DC from the replaced spell, and if the spell involves an attack roll, use the attack bonus from the living spell's Magical Strike.

For example, if you turn fireball (a 3rd-level spell) into a living spell, customize the living lightning bolt. The living fireball has immunity to fire damage, instead of lightning damage; deals fire damage with its Magical Strike; and replicates fireball with Spell Mimicry.

The magewright's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). To cast one of its rituals, the magewright must provide additional material components whose value in gold pieces is 20 times the spell's level. These components are consumed when the ritual is finished. The magewright knows the following spells:

	• At will: mage hand, prestidigitation</text>
    </trait>
    <spells>mage hand, prestidigitation</spells>
    <description>In Khorvaire, magic is part of everyday life. A chef might use prestidigitation to heat and season food, while a blacksmith uses mending to perform minor repairs and guidance to help inspire their work. Those who work minor magic into their labors are called magewrights.

Far more limited in magical power than a typical spellcaster, a magewright is dedicated to learning a handful of spells, and magewrights cast their non-cantrip spells as rituals—even spells that can't normally be cast in this way. Most magewright rituals take 10 minutes to perform, but certain complex rituals can take up to 1 hour. However long the ritual takes, it requires extra material components, usually in the form of dragonshards.

Creating a Magewright:
The magewright stat block provides the baseline statistics for a magewright. You then add to that baseline by choosing a specialty from the Magewright Specialties table, or roll for one. The specialty determines additional spells the magewright knows, including ones that can be cast only as rituals. The specialty also gives the magewright more proficiencies.

Magewright Specialties:
d8 | Specialty | Spells | Proficiencies
1 | Artisan | Guidance, mending | One type of artisan's tools
2 | Entertainer | Minor illusion, thaumaturgy. Ritual only: disguise self. | Performance (+3)
3 | Healer | Resistance, spare the dying. Ritual only: detect poison and disease, lesser restoration (1 hour). | Medicine (+4), herbalism kit
4 | Lamplighter | Light. Ritual only: continual flame (1 hour). | Tinker's tools
5 | Locksmith | Mending. Ritual only: arcane lock (1 hour), knock. | Thieves' tools, tinker's tools
6 | Mediator | Guidance. Ritual only: comprehend languages, zone of truth. | Insight (+4), Persuasion (+3)
7 | Medium | Minor illusion. Ritual only: speak with dead. | Deception (+3), Religion (+4)
8 | Oracle | Guidance. Ritual only: augury, divination (1 hour). | History (+4), Religion (+4)

    <description>In the age when fiends and dragons waged war across Eberron, rakshasas served the fiendish lords as strategists and generals. A rakshasa named Mordakhesh rose up through the ranks to become one of the greatest commanders of his age, and a dragon-slaying specialist. For this, he earned the nickname Shadowsword, along with a legendary reputation for leaving death in his wake.

Mordakhesh serves as the prakhutu or "speaker" of his imprisoned master, Rak Tulkhesh, and he seeks to free his lord by bathing the world in blood. Like a spider with multiple webs, he has agents and pawns (which he calls his "claws") established in armies across Khorvaire. The most significant of those is the barbarian horde he amasses in the Demon Wastes—warriors who threaten to sweep into Aundair on a tide of blood.

Many of the horrors of the Last War were instigated—or at least encouraged—by Mordakhesh's operatives, and his claws are known to have perpetrated some of the most brutal massacres of that conflict. No one knows how far the Shadowsword's reach extends, or which commanders in the armies of Khorvaire serve him.

    <description>A radiant idol was an angel that was banished from the celestial realm of Syrania and cast down to the Material Plane. One sin led to their fall: the desire to be worshiped by mortals. Now in the mortal realm, most radiant idols gather cults of devoted followers.

Fallen Angels:
The insatiable hunger to be adored can transform a fallen angel, physically and mentally. In its true form, a radiant idol appears to be a warped angel. It might have bloody stumps in place of its wings, or its wings could be weighted down with chains representing its pride. A radiant idol uses disguise self to hide its corruption, presenting an image of celestial glory.

The Weight of Corruption:
When a radiant idol achieves a sizable following through silvered words and demonstrations of power, its facade begins to crack, and a downward spiral ensues. As the radiant idol sinks deeper into the realm of material power, it begins twisting its followers, leading them ever deeper into ominous ritualism, hedonistic folly, and fanatical doom.

Immortal Nature:
A radiant idol doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>Immortal Nature. An overlord doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep. It also can't die permanently. Upon its death, it reforms elsewhere in the multiverse and becomes active again at a time set by the DM.

In the first days of the world, the children of Khyber rose from the darkness to reign over Eberron. The greatest among them were the overlords, who held dominion over a world of fear, war, and death until the children of Eberron and Siberys rose up against them. Armies of dragons fought against the fiends of Khyber. And though the overlords couldn't be destroyed, the couatl sacrificed their lives to build a prison of celestial light: a silver flame that bound the overlords in Khyber once more. These bonds have held for countless generations, but the overlords still yearn to break free and reclaim the world above.

As long as the overlords are bound by the Silver Flame, they can't physically manifest in the world. But each overlord embodies a particular aspect of evil, which grows in strength as their servants—the fiends known as the Lords of Dust—scheme to unleash their ancient masters. The overlords gain strength when mortals embrace the dark paths laid down for them. And as they grow stronger, they gain more influence.

Some thirty overlords are bound in Khyber. Two are described here: Rak Tulkhesh and Sul Khatesh, both of whom remain imprisoned and can't take physical form. The stat blocks provided here reflect the powers they would wield if they were ever unleashed upon the world.

    <description>Shifters are tied to primal spirits, which most of them refer to as the beast within. They are lithe of form and have bestial features: large eyes, flat noses, pointed ears, and light fur over much of their bodies. When a shifter fully embraces the beast within by "shifting," these features become even more pronounced.

    <description>Immortal Nature. An overlord doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep. It also can't die permanently. Upon its death, it reforms elsewhere in the multiverse and becomes active again at a time set by the DM.

In the first days of the world, the children of Khyber rose from the darkness to reign over Eberron. The greatest among them were the overlords, who held dominion over a world of fear, war, and death until the children of Eberron and Siberys rose up against them. Armies of dragons fought against the fiends of Khyber. And though the overlords couldn't be destroyed, the couatl sacrificed their lives to build a prison of celestial light: a silver flame that bound the overlords in Khyber once more. These bonds have held for countless generations, but the overlords still yearn to break free and reclaim the world above.

As long as the overlords are bound by the Silver Flame, they can't physically manifest in the world. But each overlord embodies a particular aspect of evil, which grows in strength as their servants—the fiends known as the Lords of Dust—scheme to unleash their ancient masters. The overlords gain strength when mortals embrace the dark paths laid down for them. And as they grow stronger, they gain more influence.

Some thirty overlords are bound in Khyber. Two are described here: Rak Tulkhesh and Sul Khatesh, both of whom remain imprisoned and can't take physical form. The stat blocks provided here reflect the powers they would wield if they were ever unleashed upon the world.

    <description>Tarkanan assassins are the elite killers, spies, and thieves who work for House Tarkanan, a criminal organization specializing in theft and assassination. In addition to their deadly skill, a Tarkanan assassin possesses an aberrant dragonmark—a twisted sigil that provides them with magical power. House Tarkanan actively seeks and recruits people with aberrant dragonmarks.

Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells.
------
The power granted by an aberrant dragonmark is unpredictable. When running a Tarkanan assassin, you can roll on the Aberrant Dragonmark Innate Spells table to determine the spells gained from that NPC's aberrant mark, replacing the spells in the stat block's Innate Spellcasting trait.

    <description>The Lord of Blades is a warforged warlord who has broken all ties with his former masters. He has established a nation for his people deep in the Mournland, centered in a great fortress where warforged from all over Khorvaire can come and feel a sense of belonging. No one knows what the Lord of Blades plans for his followers, but many fear that he intends to build a legion of warforged zealots, primed to march from the Mournland to unleash destruction on their former masters.

Some tales assert that the Lord of Blades led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Others cast him as a newer warforged, perhaps the last to come out of the Cannith creation forges before the Thronehold Accords led to their dismantling. One story claims the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans to repeat the Day of Mourning in each of the remaining Five Nations. Whatever the truth, he has become a beacon for warforged everywhere.

Warforged Nature:
The Lord of Blades doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

One humanoid that the quori can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the quori; the quori then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The quori now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The quori can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the quori ends it as a bonus action, or the quori is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the quori reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this quori's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>

    <description>Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmares—the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.

A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the councilor casts this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (its choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.</text>

    <description>The undying are undead creatures sustained by positive energy or the devotion of mortal beings. Where strong negative emotions can trap a spirit as a ghost or wraith, the undying are spirits who linger because they are cherished and who in turn seek to protect and guide the people of their community.

Though it's possible for undying to appear anywhere, it is rare for them to manifest naturally. The only place where they are found in significant numbers is the island of Aerenal, a land whose close ties to the plane of Irian suffuse it with positive energy. The elves of Aerenal spent thousands of years working to develop rituals that tap into this energy, allowing them to preserve their greatest citizens as undying.

The Face of Death:
The light of Irian sustains the spirit, but it doesn't preserve the physical body. The undying appear as desiccated corpses, their flesh withering away over centuries. At the same time, the spirit of the undying surrounds the body—an aura of light forming a spectral shadow of the soul. The light shed by an undying doesn't generate heat, but it provides a sense of warmth and comfort.

The most powerful of the undying can separate their spirits from their physical forms, existing as beings of pure light. This state is the ultimate goal of the elves of Aerenal, and such beings are known as ascendant councilors.

Bound by Love and Light:
Undying are sustained by positive energy, whether found in manifest zones tied to Irian—such as in Shae Mordai, the Aereni City of the Dead—or freely given by the devotion of mortal beings. The worship of the Undying Court is what sustains the undying of Aerenal, but devotion is a finite resource. As such, each elf that becomes an undying must earn their afterlife. If an undying elf leaves Aerenal, they require a community of elves or another source of positive energy to sustain them. Failing this, their light fades and they eventually die.

The Undying Court:
The honored undead of Aerenal are united in the Undying Court. Based in the city of Shae Mordai, the members of the Undying Court spend their time meditating, engaging in research, or continuing to perfect the arts they practiced in life. They serve as guides and advisors to the living, and members of the noble lines of Aerenal can exercise the rite of counsel to consult with ancestors in Shae Mordai.

The greatest members of the Undying Court are the ascendant councilors. These beings of pure light are focused on contemplating the mysteries of life and the planes, and can work together to wield godlike power that allows them to shield Aerenal from almost any threat. However, the ascendant councilors can exercise power beyond Aerenal only by acting through devoted mortals—paladins and clerics of the Undying Court.

Undead Nature:
An undying doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

    <description>The elves of Valenar say that when their ancestors fought the giants of Xen'drik, elf druids took the forms of animals on the battlefield. The cruel and mighty Emperor Cul'sir of the giants laid a curse upon the druids and trapped them in the forms of animals. Just as the ancestors of the Valenar guide their warriors in battle, the spirits of these druids can awaken power in an animal to create a companion worthy of a champion.

Valenar animals are awakened to advanced intelligence and power by the touch of an ancestral spirit. Traditionally, Valenar animals choose Valenar elves as companions, reflecting a bond between the ancestors of elf and animal. To be chosen by a Valenar animal is a great honor, and any such elf is treated with respect and reverence. Still, on the rare occasions when a Valenar animal chooses an adventurer of a different ancestry as a companion, it is universally accepted.

The Valenar animals presented here—hawk, hound, and steed—are but examples, for the ancestral spirits can take on many animal forms.

Variant: Ancestral Traits. Each Valenar animal can be customized with an ancestral gift, a supernatural trait granted by its ancestral spirit. Choose a trait or roll on the Ancestral Traits table for each Valenar animal.

Ancestral Traits:
d8 | Trait
1 | Bestow Luck (1/Day). As a bonus action, the animal chooses one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes in the next hour has advantage.
2 | Burst of Speed (Recharge 6). The animal can take the Dash action as a bonus action.
3 | Camouflage. The animal has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes while outdoors.
4 | Lie Detector. The animal knows when a creature within 15 feet of it tells a lie.
5 | Fey Ancestry. The animal has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened, and magic can't put it to sleep.
6 | Fey Step (1/Day). The animal, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
7 | Quickness (Recharge 6). The animal can take the Dodge action as a bonus action.
8 | Shrouded Step. The animal can't be tracked except by magical means, and it leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

    <description>In the final days of the Last War, House Cannith unleashed its mightiest creations: the warforged colossi. These enormous mechanical warriors thundered across Cyre, crushing everything in their paths and leaving ruin behind them. Meant to end the war decisively, the colossi pulverized hundreds of soldiers beneath their feet and incinerated whole legions with beams of fiery light that shot from their mouths. This rampage was cut short on the Day of Mourning. The arcane cataclysm that engulfed Cyre destroyed most of the warforged colossi, causing them to collapse into lifeless heaps.

Colossal Survivors:
Some warforged colossi survived the Day of Mourning more or less intact and are thought to only be in stasis, waiting to be awakened. Cannith artificers are eager to track them down and determine whether they can be awakened or, at the very least, salvaged for docents and other magic items. Here are locations where operational warforged colossi are rumored to dwell:

	• "Arkus" (Colossus WX-11) lies prone at the bottom of the Glowing Chasm in the northern part of the Mournland, with one of its arms torn off.
	• "Artorok" (Colossus WX-73) sits at the bottom of Lake Cyre amid the scaffolding of a sunken House Cannith workshop, flooded but otherwise intact.
	• "Hanamar" (Colossus WX-42) stands at the bottom of Kraken Bay, near the coast of Valenar, buried up to its knees in sand and flooded, but it is otherwise intact.
	• "Karrnslayer" (Colossus WX-31) lost its legs but crawls through the Mournland, using its arms to drag its great bulk across the ground. It is always prone and can't use its Stomp action, but makes three extra turret attacks when it takes the Multiattack action option.
	• "Landro" (Colossus WX-33) is partially phased into a mountainside on the border of Cyre and Breland, but still explorable and potentially salvageable.
	• "Norr" (Colossus WX-5) is slumped amid the ruins of Metrol, the former capital of Cyre.
	• "Tymber" (Colossus WX-12) squats in the Crawling Swamp, in the northwest corner of the Shadow Marches. How it got there, no one knows.

Hollow Structure:
Although it can operate without a crew, a warforged colossus is built to carry wizards, artificers, magewrights, and elite troops. For this reason, these constructs are largely hollow on the inside, with tunnels, ladders, storage areas, and observation decks.

A colossus might be filled with monsters and secrets, in addition to the corpses of those who died inside it. In chapter 4, map 4.8 illustrates an inactive warforged colossus, and the text that accompanies it explains how the colossus might serve as an adventure location.

    <description>Warforged soldiers are humanoids formed from wood and steel, then magically imbued with life and sentience. The warforged were created to fight in the Last War, and in the aftermath of that conflict, they struggle to understand their place in the world.

Most warforged soldiers still serve their former masters, often guarding dragonmarked houses or merchant caravans. Many warforged find it difficult to separate themselves from the soldiers they were made to be, seeking work as bouncers, bailiffs, and bodyguards. Others put their tireless strength to work as laborers, committed to the reconstruction of the towns and cities they defended or destroyed in the war.

    <description>Warforged titans are hulking constructs built to wreak paths of destruction through enemy armies. Some of the most feared combatants of the Last War, warforged titans are barely sentient, with just enough intelligence to follow commands.

Legacy of Giants:
In the Age of Giants, giant artificers built mindless war golems to aid them in their war against the quori. Millennia later, some of these golems were unearthed by adventurers searching for the secrets of that age, then turned over to artificers working for the dragonmarked houses during the Last War. House Cannith studied these designs, and in the course of uncovering the secrets of the golems and the giant artificers who made them, House Cannith created the first warforged titans.

    <spells>detect thoughts, disguise self, shield</spells>
    <description>Millions of years before the rise of the humanoid races, the rakshasas of Eberron ruled a civilization that spanned Khorvaire. Masters of combat, the rakshasas of Eberron wield their weapons with demonic fury, rushing into battle seeking vengeance against those who bound their fiendish masters.

Rakshasas are described in the Monster Manual. A martial variant—the zakya rakshasa—is presented here.

Zakya rakshasas are the bloodthirsty foot soldiers of the rakshasa horde. They are driven to free their fiendish rulers, seeking vengeance against the dragons and those who revere the couatls. Unlike other rakshasas with their luxurious robes and fineries, zakya rakshasas are almost always clad in battle gear: well-worn scale mail, a razor-sharp longsword, and a heavy shield bearing the emblem of their demonic master.
